## Features

- Create and display notes with different background colors.

## How it Works

The NotesWall application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Here's how each component contributes to its functionality:

### HTML (index.html)

The HTML file sets up the structure of the web page, including the note input area and the section to display notes.

### CSS (style tag)

The CSS file provides styling to the different elements of the NotesWall application, such as the note input area, individual notes, and their background colors.

### JavaScript (script tag)

The JavaScript file provides interactivity to the NotesWall application:

- It handles adding new notes with custom colors.
- It dynamically updates the UI to display the added notes with their respective colors.
